    <h2>How It has changed my life...</h2>
    <p>I learn the importance of strength. Strength and conditioning builds muscle and helps prevent injury to your body. Nutrition is also important during an injury to minimize the off time and regain strength quickly. Respect is a life skill that is taught each and every time a gymnast is in the gym. I now practice gymnasitcs 5 days a week and do it for 3 hours. I get home at 8: 30 at night and then do all my homework. I have to handle school and the sport. It also helps you in different activites like dance you have routines that are created specially for you.</p>
