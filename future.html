    <h2>High School</h2>
    <p>I want to attend Millikan High School. I am interested in the compass program. It seems the most fun and easiest way to get through high school. In this program you do alot of arts. For example there is dance, drawing, painting, photography, chorus, and muscial theater. I  want to take beginning dance, gymnastics, and drawing/painting in the first year. <a href="https://dash.generalassemb.ly/gymnast__eryn/build-your-own-business-website"target="_blank">More about these high school.</a></li>

    <h2>College</h2>
    <p> I want to attend UCLA or USC but my first choice would be UCLA.(It matches the color of the high school I want to go to) I want to major in physical thearpy. My brother and I want to do the same job but different colleges. College will teach me about college tests your emotional limits as much as your intellectual ones and the coping skills you pick up will follow you on past graduation.
